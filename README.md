#Portfolio Generator

Truth be told, I'm pretty sick of Wordpress. I wind up changing the theme every time I update my work, so why not just start from scratch and keep it in HTML / Markdown?

Uses [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), a static-site-generator written in Python. I'm learning to love it <3.
